![Design preview for the Planets fact site coding challenge](./preview.jpg)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹ ðŸš€ 

### The challenge

Build out this 8-page planets fact site and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- View each planet page and toggle between "Overview", "Internal Structure", and "Surface Geology"

### What was provided:

+ .json data
+ barebones html for each page
+ images for each page
+ figma/sketch design file with theme sheet

### Building the project

1. Planning overall HTML architecture and semantics
2. Setting CSS (Sass) globals, importing fonts and roughing out styling for main elements
3. Designed 'mobile first' with responsive resizing based on screen resolution
4. Work to add mobile menu functionality and create .jason fetches to pull in data to populate pages
5. Repeat HTML structure across all pages

### Personal Challenge!!

I decided to take a JS-heavy approach, using the provided local `data.json` file for the planets. I have yet to work with pulling in data sets from .json files and adding them to the DOM via JS - seemed like a great challenge to futher my familiarity with JS and working with data.
